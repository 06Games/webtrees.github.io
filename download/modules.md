### JustLight theme - by JustCarmen - `1.7` - [website](https://justcarmen.nl/themes/justlight-theme) - [demo](https://wijzijnfamilie.nl)

This is a modern theme in clean white and blue. The layout is adjusted as much as possible
for use on touch devices like tablets and mobile phones.
The menu is responsive. This means it will collapse on smaller screens and have only
clickable items. You might be used to hover over a menu item to get it’s submenu but
on touch devices the hover functionality doesn’t exist. The tabs at the individual
page are replaced by bootstrap panels for a better layout on mobile devices.
Also the sidebar will collapse automatically when viewing from smaller screens.

There is also a [JustLight theme options](https://github.com/JustCarmen/justlight_theme_options)
module which customises the JustLight theme and provides more features.

### Rural theme - by jon48 - `1.7` - [website](https://github.com/jon48/webtrees-theme-rural) - [demo](https://genea.jaubart.com/wt)

It is mainly based on brown tones, as a tribute to the earth our ancestors used to cultivate, with some green, color of nature. Contrary to the majority of themes, it does not use the whole width of the screen, but wrap the content within a white panel on a brown background.
