GEDCOM stands for “**GE**nealogy **D**ata **COM**munciation”. It is a file-format used to transfer genealogy data from one application to another.  It was created by the Church Of Latter Day Saints and has since become a standard format used by almost all genealogy applications.

Version 5.5.1 was draft for over 20 years before being finally issued.

webtrees aims to follow the 5.5.1 standard, while also supporting some
of the more common extensions that were created by other applications.
