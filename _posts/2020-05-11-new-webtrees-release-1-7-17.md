webtrees 1.7.17 is now available for download.

It contains translation updates and two bug fixes.

One allowed unescaped HTML to be included in certain reports.

The other prevented the upgrade wizard from fetching remote files.
 
See the [change log](https://github.com/fisharebest/webtrees/compare/1.7.16...1.7.17) for details.
