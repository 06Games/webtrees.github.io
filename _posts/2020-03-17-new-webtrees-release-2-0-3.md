webtrees 2.0.3 is now available for download.

EXIF data is now used to auto-rotate photographs.

The location editor in the control panel now uses the OpenStreetMap
database for searching.  (Thanks to ddrury.)

The default language has been changed from a tree-preference to a
site-preference.

Third-party modules can now show available updates in the control panel.

Internal support has been added for the GEDCOM `HEAD` and `SUBN` records.
This is in preparation for supporting custom record types, such as `_LOC`.

Fixes for over 100 reported issues.  [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/fisharebest/webtrees/compare/2.0.2...2.0.3)
