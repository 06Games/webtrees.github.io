webtrees 2.0.9 is now available for download.

This is a replacement for 2.0.8 which contained a bug in the auto-upgrade code.
If you installed 2.0.8, you should read the [special upgrade instructions]({% link _upgrade/index.md %}), 

There is one new feature.  Surname fields now use an auto-complete lookup.

See the [change log](https://github.com/fisharebest/webtrees/compare/2.0.8...2.0.9)
for a complete list of updates and bug-fixes.
