The text size is not set by webtrees. It is set by your browser.
webtrees uses the size you choose in your browser preferences.
Many common browsers have a default of 16px (12pt).

A 2018 study[^IA], found that over 3% of users change the text size.
Almost all set it **larger** than 16px.

Web standards organisations recommend[^W3C] that websites respect
the text size specified by the browser.
Accessibility organisations recommend[^WEBAIM] [^AWEB] 16px.
User Experience experts recommend[^SMASH] [^NNG] 16px.

Respecting the user’s default setting is also important for some non-latin character sets.
For example, Chinese characters are difficult to read at smaller text sizes.

Dyslexia affects approximately 10%[^NHS] of the population.
Organisations representing people with Dyslexia recommend[^BDA] [^DAI]
a text size of 16–19px with a line spacing of 1.5.
